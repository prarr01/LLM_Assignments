    "### 1. **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)**  \n",
    "Developed by OpenAI, **CLIP** is a multimodal model that learns to associate images with corresponding textual descriptions through contrastive learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Types**: Image + Text  \n",
    "- **Architecture**:\n",
    "  - Uses separate encoders: Vision Transformer (ViT) or ResNet for images, Transformer for text.\n",
    "  - Embeds both modalities into a shared vector space.\n",
    "  - Trained on a massive dataset of image-caption pairs.\n",
    "- **Key Applications**:\n",
    "  - Zero-shot image classification\n",
    "  - Image retrieval using natural language queries\n",
    "  - General-purpose vision-language understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)**  \n",
    "Developed by Salesforce Research, **BLIP** improves upon earlier vision-language models by incorporating **captioning**, **filtering**, and **refinement** mechanisms during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Types**: Image + Text  \n",
    "- **Architecture**:\n",
    "  - Encoder-decoder framework based on Vision Transformer and BERT.\n",
    "  - Includes a **Captioning Module** to generate captions from images.\n",
    "  - Uses a **Filtering Module** to select reliable captions.\n",
    "  - Has a **Refinement Module** to improve noisy captions.\n",
    "- **Key Applications**:\n",
    "  - Image captioning\n",
    "  - Visual question answering (VQA)\n",

    "- Uses a sequence-to-sequence approach where the image acts as context for generating text.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we compared **CLIP** and **BLIP**, two representative multimodal models that bridge the gap between visual and textual data. While **CLIP** excels in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks due to its contrastive learning setup, **BLIP** offers richer generative capabilities, particularly in captioning and visual question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models use different strategies to handle **cross-modal inputs**:\n",
    "- CLIP uses **independent encoders** aligned in a shared space.\n",
    "- BLIP uses an **encoder-decoder** structure with attention to better integrate visual and linguistic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These differences make each model suitable for distinct application domains, highlighting the importance of choosing the right model based on the task at hand.\n",
